# MathematicalModeling

This is a repository of all my work and studies for my Mathematical Modeling course at the University of South Florida.

It consists of various assignments with completed R Markdown reports on mathematical modeling applied to biological, ecological, and evolutionary dynamics related to population growth, genetic drift, and disease models.
